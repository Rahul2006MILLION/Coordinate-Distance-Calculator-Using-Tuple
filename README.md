# Coordinate-Distance-Calculator-Using-Tuple
Takes two 2D coordinates as input, stores them as nested tuples, and calculates the Euclidean distance using math.sqrt(). Demonstrates tuple creation, nesting, unpacking, and basic math operations in Python.
# 📐 2D Distance Calculator

A simple Python CLI program that calculates the distance between two points in 2D space using the distance formula. It accepts coordinate input from the user, displays the points, and outputs the exact distance between them.

## 📌 Features

- Accepts `x` and `y` coordinates for two points
- Displays both points and their combined tuple
- Calculates the 2D Euclidean distance using the distance formula
- Formats output distance to two decimal places

## 📐 Formula Used

The program uses the **distance formula**: Distance = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]
